hello, this is my attempt to make a meteor client addon

the addon i am hoping to perduce is a addon to baritone, i chose to make a meteor addon because i think it will be easyer to edit settings

what im hoping the addon will include:
a text box for where you can put an api key for groqcloud, (groqcloud is a free llm)
i am hoping to make it like alto cleft mod, execpt controled by an AI to execute tasks, such as get diamond tools, ect
